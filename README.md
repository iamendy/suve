# SUVe with Axelar

## ‚ú® Inspiration

In Fiscal year 2020, Department of Homeland security seized over $1.3b worth of counterfeit goods at US border. This is a tiny fraction of the many scenerios happening globally. With the inception of Covid-19, and a rush to find a fast and effective solution, we have witnessed a rise in counterfeit vaccines. This has cost thousands of human lives, especially in emerging countries. Suve is a dApp that takles this problem.

## üç∞ What SUVe does

Unlike traditional dApps that are deployed and run in parallel, SUVe allows users on different blockchain ecosystems to query from one single source of truth. To showcase this technique, I developed a Vaccine verification system using the powerful Axelar inter-chain technology. Suve works by implementing a 2-way General Message Passing to enable communication between Enrollment Service on the source blockchain and Verifification service on other blockchains, to verify the autheticity of vaccines.

## üìú Interchain Transaction for Vaccine verification

## üíª How I built SUVe

I created 2 EVM smart contracts in Solidity, [**EnrollmentService.sol**](https://github.com/iamendy/suve/blob/master/contracts/Enrol.sol) and [**VerificationService.sol**](https://github.com/iamendy/suve/blob/master/contracts/Verify.sol). The EnrollmentService is the source of truth and deployed on the Avalanche Blockchain. The EnrollmentService is where a pharmacetucal company can register their vaccines, while the VerificationService is deployed on three of the many EVM compatible chains supported by Axelar(Celo, Fantom, and Ploygon). These smart contracts uses Axelar 2-way General Message Passing to make cross-chain call between VerificationService(Request) on other blockchains and EnrollmentService(Response).

For the front end, I used **`NextJs/Typescript`** with **`Wagmi`**. I also used **`RainbowKit`** for wallets integration. The dApp uses **`AxelarJs SDK`** on API endpoints which implements `AxelarQueryAPI` and `AxelarGMPRecoveryAPI` to get interchain estimated gas, as well as track the entire 2-way GMP process on the frontend. A user only has to switch to the supported blockchain, and is automatically hooked up for verification.

## üöÄ Accomplishments that I'm proud of

üç• I implemented an inter-chain verification system that wouldn't have been possible without Axelar.
üç• I showcased how different blockchains can interact and sync data as one super DApp.
üç• I implemented 2-way GMP UI tracking on the frontend, using AlexarJs SDK. This allowing users monitor progress without leaving the dApp.
üç• I really enjoyed studying the Axelar technology, and the myraids of potentials it unlocks for the blockchain ecosystem.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Experience learning and using Axelar

‚úÖ The interchain capability allowed me bring this idea to life <br/>
‚úÖ I'm more of a visual learner, so the video resources on Youtube really helped bring me up to speed, then the docs became super easy to understand <br />
‚úÖ Once you get familiar with Axelar, you really appreciate the work put in to make docs easily absorbed.

‚ûñ I noticed that sometimes transactions don't show up quickly on Axelar scan, so the AxelarJs SDK was my favourite way of checking transactions. <br />
‚ûñ Axelar scan keeps reloading thereby making it difficult to actually study the report <br>

## üìà What's next for SUVe

I'm happy to have built this app. I was marvelled at the ease of connecting different blockchains. I plan on:

- Expanding the Enrollment service into a Factory Contract, to allow bespoke enrollment and Verification service that is not limited to vaccines, but other business niches like automobiles, fashion, etc
- Expanding the service to the Cosmos ecosystem
- Integrate the Service to allow inter-chain verification using NFTs (ERC721, ERC1155)

Thank you! I hope you enjoyed my interchain-chain verification dApp that saves lives for web3 users, and expands the web3 ecosystem using Axelar.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Instructions for testing locally

1. Deploy `EnrollmentService` on Avalanche (Or any Axelar supported chain you wish) with the respective GateWay and Gas Service:

   For Avalanche

   - gateway = `0xC249632c2D40b9001FE907806902f63038B737Ab`
   - gasReceiver = `0xbE406F0189A0B4cf3A05C286473D23791Dd44Cc6`

2. Deploy `VerificationService` on any Axelar-supported chain, such as Celo as shown here:

   For Celo

   - gateway = `0xe432150cce91c13a887f7D836923d5597adD8E31`
   - gasReceiver = `0xbE406F0189A0B4cf3A05C286473D23791Dd44Cc6`
   - VaccineEnrollmentService = `address of your deployed EnrollmentService`
   - VESChain = `Avalanche`
     \*You can deploy to as many chains as you wish.

3. On the dApp, visit the enrollment dashboard to register Vaccnines by filling the form which uploads the image to IPFS and interacts with `EnrollmentService.enroll()`:

4. The dApp is chain aware and will automatically switch to the right service as you change compatible networks.

5. Verify the vaccine you uploaded on the different blockchains by entering the hash on the verify page.
